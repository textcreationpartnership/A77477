            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>YOu and all good men would think it no ſmall happineſs to the Chriſtian World, if true Religion might reign as a Law unthwarted, unoppoſed, and the Orthodox Faith, being obſcured by no Queſtions and
<pb facs="tcp:152572:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>Cavils were onely publiſhed and not diſputed. Faith and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion may fitly be reſembled to a pure and liquid ſtream, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes muddy being troubled; and as by an Inundation of water the Field or Meadow adjoyning is turned into an miry pit: So when Contentions, which the wiſe man compares to an overflowing of water, overſpreads the green Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures of Sacred truth, much filth of error thereby cleavs to them. Hence have Faith and Religion themſelves come into queſtion, though of all other things they be moſt certain and indubitate; And as plants often removed cannot take root and proſper, ſo Faith and Piety being removed out of their ancient ſtanding, and bended this way and that way according to
<pb facs="tcp:152572:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>mens humors, looſe their reverence and ſtability, and do decay in the lives of men, and Atheiſm gets ground. Hence it is that, one gainſaying another, one plucks down what ſhould be by a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon labour and conſent built up. And hence it is, that as it is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for a man to follow guides whoſe backs are turned each of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and their faces a clean con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary way; ſo Gods people, who ſhould be led by their ſpiritual guides in one beaten path of Faith and Godlineſs, are with unſpeaka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble peril diſtracted (not knowing what to do) while their leaders call them contrary wayes. By this (in a word) do we Chriſtians be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a Reproach both to Jewes and Gentiles, and we Proteſtants to the deriſion of Turks and Papiſts
<pb facs="tcp:152572:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>while our Church is broken in ſo many factions, while <hi>Aarons</hi> bells do jangle all men are in an uproar and fall together by the Ears, and the fire of unchriſtian animoſities become too often like that of the Temple, never to be extinguiſhed. But, which is the worſt of all, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion hereby becomes (as it were) heart eaten. I mean, the heart of it, that is, the practiſe of Holineſs and Righteouſneſs, daily decayeth, for when ſome men are loath to put themſelves to the trouble of an holy life they readily liſt themſelves under a party, not doubting to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire to themſelves a glorious name, if they be but zealous in the defence of a tittle or punctilio, how careleſs ſoever they be in the eſſential duties of the Kingdome of God.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:152572:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <p>Indeed how this ſhould be, how the Chriſtian Religion ſhould be quarrell'd about, is next to a Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, conſidering what benignity and ſweetneſs of diſpoſition, what candour and ingenuity of Spirit, what humility and mutual conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcention it requireth! But <hi>aut hoc non eſt Evangelium, aut non ſumus Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelici;</hi> Either this is not the Right practice of Chriſtianity, or it is not calculated for our Meridian, wherein abound ſo much pride and uncharitableneſs, ſo many ſtrifes and diviſions, ſo much wrath and envy, confuſion and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very evil work. How far diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent are ours to thoſe pure primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive times wherein Religion true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly flouriſhed; For then was the ſpirit of Meekneſs and gentleneſs and peacableneſs accounted the
<pb facs="tcp:152572:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>indiſpenſable duties and characte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſtical notes of real Godlineſs. The greateſt inſtance of piety in the firſt Chriſtians was to dye and not to fight for Chriſt; they had not then learnt to make way for Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines or opinions by the dint of the ſword. And ſurely no reaſon can be alledged why Chriſtians ſhould not act by the ſame rule and ſtand upon the ſame ground now as then? But that can never be, while theſe partition walls are daily ſet up amongſt us? while men are dayly forſaking our Church Aſſemblies and racking their brains, and purſes and intereſts to found or defend their private Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in oppoſition unto them. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed this ſeems to be the way to perpetuate a ſchiſm in the midſt of us, and as it were to eſtabliſh it by a
<pb facs="tcp:152572:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>Law, which we and our Poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty may have ſad cauſe to lament, when it is paſt all prevention or Cure.</p>
                  <p>To prevent the unſpeakable Miſchiefes (the Prologue of utter deſtruction) I conceive it the duty of all men in their ſeveral places, to beſtir themſelves in time, but eſpecially of Magiſtrates and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, and it is my ambition to be ſome way inſtrumental to remove the cauſes, which hath (willingly) carried me to this hazard, firſt to Preach and then to Print theſe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing Sermons. How ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able they are to the end for which they are deſigned I leave it to your Worſhips conſiderations to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine.</p>
                  <p>Indeed when I firſt reſolved to publiſh them I could have no diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
<pb facs="tcp:152572:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>with my ſelf to whom to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate them. Firſt, upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of my great perſonal obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to you, for thoſe conſtant reſpects you have been pleaſed to expreſs unto my perſon ever ſince <hi>I</hi> had the happineſs to be acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with and ſeated near you, and alſo for that eminent love of God and his Church and truth the world hath experienced, and muſt upon all occaſions gratefully acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in you, to the praiſe of God that raiſeth up ſuch worthies. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, the very matter of the book ſeems as much to concern your ſelf and other good Magiſtrates, as us the Miniſters of the Church. For theſe two Offices are ſo inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately related; Church and State, Prince and Prieſt, Magiſtrate and Miniſter are ſo nearly and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
<pb facs="tcp:152572:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>conjoyned in a mutual inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, that like <hi>Hippocrates</hi> his twins they rejoyce and mourn, flouriſh and periſh together. They have moſt what in all ages fared alike in the world Both are deputies un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and inſtruments of, and actors for God in their ſeveral Miniſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. And therefore, the Devil doth alike malice them both, and ſtirs up his inſtruments, either to corrupt them, or remove theſe ſacred fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions from their purity and inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity if it be poſſible, or elſe to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet and deſtroy them. God leadeth his people like a flock by the hands of <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Pſ. 37.20.</note>, and therefore the enemies of the flock have an equal ſpite to both theſe two lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. In all Ages of the Church almoſt, ſince it was conſtituted and eſtabliſhed, and ſince Kings
<pb facs="tcp:152572:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>and Queens have become the nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Fathers and nurſing Mothers thereof, if the one have proſpered ſo have the other; and if the times were dark and gloomy and adverſe to the one ſo have they to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p>As for our preſent diſtractions, However the adverſary may with ſmooth words ſofter than butter, ſtroke the Magiſtrate &amp; flatter him into contentment and ſatisfaction, as if things where as well or better in a ſtate of indulgence and Tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as they were before, and how ever they may ſtrive to reduce him into a <hi>Gallio's</hi> temper not to be troubled or careful for any of theſe matters, yet in my opinion the caſe ſeems harder to Magiſtrates that have care and conſcience to ſerve the Lord in that capacity, and
<pb facs="tcp:152572:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>to preſerve his Church in truth and peace, than to the Miniſters of the Church. For whereas, our Mouths (bleſſed be God) are not ſhut though our adverſaries are open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but we may ſtill freely lift up our voices as a trumpet to tell <hi>Juda</hi> of her ſins and ſo deliver our own ſouls; yet (alas) the Magiſtrate<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> hands ſeems to be bound by the ſuſpenſion of the Lawes, ſo that he cannot proceed in the diſcharge of his office with courage &amp; efficacy.</p>
                  <p>In this caſe what ſhould <hi>Aaron</hi> do but lift up <hi>Moſes</hi> his hands? it remains that <hi>I</hi> and my Brethren ſhould call upon you and yours, not to be diſmayed at theſe things but wait upon God in the Faithful fulfilling of your duties to your utmoſt power, not doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but that God hath his time, his
<pb facs="tcp:152572:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>proper ſeaſon for all things, and while he governs the world, all things will work together for the good of the Church in the end.</p>
                  <p>If then, in ſtead of ſpeaking <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centia,</hi> pleaſing things (for with <hi>Elihu</hi> in <hi>Job,</hi>

                  <head>To his well beloved People, the members of the Pariſh of <hi>Kirkburton.</hi> And to every Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Reader, the Author wiſheth Grace and Peace</head>
                  <p>BELIEVE me, it is no vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glorious Deſire of being in Print (it were a folly to hope for any acceſs of Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation hereby in this ſo Critical and Cenſorious an age,) nor do I think the World wanteth books, and thoſe excellent ones, upon this ſubject; nor do I offer any new ſpeculations concerning it; nor do I plead (though perhaps I might as well as others) the importunity of any Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian friends Invitation to embolden, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
<pb facs="tcp:152572:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>or oblige me to this impreſſion; nor theſe nor any of theſe did move me effectually unto it; But as it was that ſolicitous care I had of your preſent and everlaſting Welfare that did at firſt engage me to Preach upon theſe ſubjects; ſo the very ſame fire burning ſtill in my heart, being earneſtly deſirous the truths herein delivered may not be forgotten by you, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven while you have uſe for them, this (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt irreſiſtibly) urged me to enter upon the ſtage, to encounter the harſh Cenſures, I ſeriouſly expect for it.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Sermons you know, (together with others upon other texts relating to this ſubject, which to imprint alſo, would ſwell the book to too great a bulk) was preached both in Church and Chappel. The deſign of them was evidently to deal with your Conſciences and inform them aright in this preſent juncture of publick affairs, what your Obligation is to your own Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors, and to prevent your Chiſmatical for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaking the Publick Aſſemblies to joyn to an Independant Conventicle. (Pardon me if I miſtake it, for I believe it cannot, as it is circumſtantiated, conſiſt with the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of the old ſober Presbyterians, nor yet with the Modern, that have any remains
<pb facs="tcp:152572:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>of ſettled principles concerning Church unity and Church Aſſemblies in them). But having preacht them I eaſily perceived all my labours utterly loſt and uſeleſs to many that either would not or could not hear them, or elſe baſely without any ſhew of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon reflected on them. Hence I began to deſire, they might have ſome way of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving themſelves further to the World, and eſpecially that they might be expoſed with better advantage to your more ſerious and retired conſideration and peruſal, and if it were poſſible that they might be known unto, and narrowly examined by all under my charge. Theſe and other Motives (e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially knowing that other books of better worth of this or like ſubjects have never reacht your hands, nor in likelyhood ever will do) being entertained, prevailed and wrought a trembling reſolution in me to offer them firſt to ſome Chriſtian friends peruſal, and after to put them upon this publick tryal, though at firſt in compoſing them I never purpoſed more than the delivering them <hi>(vivâ voce)</hi> to your pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate audience.</p>
                  <p>It is admirable to conſider how this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular national Church ſuffers by Tradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Blaſphemies on all hands. Meet,
<pb facs="tcp:152572:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>as Chriſt was crucified betwixt two thieves; ſo on the one ſide, the Papiſts A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nathematize us (the Faithful Miniſters and Members of the Church of <hi>England</hi>) becauſe we are the moſt profeſſed enemies to their uſurpations, Idolatries and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitions: &amp; on the other ſide the ſeparating Members of our Church do hate and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligne us, and ſometimes ſaucily and petu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantly brand us with Popery and Idolatry, and ſo make us limbs of Anti-chriſt, and therefore no true or faithful Churches of Chriſt, and that meerly for thoſe few inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent indifferent, &amp; ſignificant ceremonies, which we retain and obſerve for the order and decency of the Worſhip of God. Thus are Chriſts ſheep in the midſt of Wolves. His Spouſe a woman in the Wilderneſs of wilde Beaſts of all ſorts; this is <hi>Ephraim</hi> againſt <hi>Manaſſeh,</hi> and <hi>Manaſſeh</hi> againſt <hi>Ephraim,</hi> but both againſt <hi>Juda; Herod</hi> and <hi>Pontius Pilate</hi> made friends, Phariſees and Saddu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces combining and agreeing againſt Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>But bleſſed be God ſo ſafe is our Church, and ſo warrantable is our ſtanding in it, that this Flag of Defiance we can hold out against all Sadduces and Opponents, that we have, (in moſt of our adverſaries con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions) thoſe things in the Midſt of us that in the judgements of all the Reformed
<pb facs="tcp:152572:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>Churches (as may appear by the Harmony of their confeſſions) are the only undoubted marks and infallible characters of a true Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Church, where ever they are. Such are the pure preaching of the Word of God, and the Right Adminiſtration of the Sacraments. And this I made good to you upon that text, <hi>Acts 2.42.</hi> which I truſt you will remember.</p>
                  <p>Now whoever is once aſſured that the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Church he lives in, and in which he was baptized, is a true Viſible Church of Chriſt. He can never have juſt cauſe (while it remains ſuch eſſentially) to ſeparate from it, but ought to live and reſt with quietneſs and chearfulneſs of Spirit in communion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. For it is every mans duty to profeſs himſelf a Chriſtian, and to own his Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on publickly, and therefore publickly to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of and frequent the Ordinances and Sacraments of the Goſpel in order thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, but this he cannot do without ſociety and communion with ſome Church or other. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Chriſtian as ſuch is bound to look upon himſelf as a member of a Body. <hi>viz.</hi> The Viſible Church of Chriſt; but how can he be known to be a member who is not united with the other parts of the Body?</p>
                  <p>Hence follows, that upon all Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans there lyes an Obligation to engage in a Religious ſociety with others for partaking
<pb facs="tcp:152572:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>of the ordinances of the Goſpel. Now a Chriſti an, being actually joyned in Church ſociety with other Chriſtians, is ſo long bound to maintain ſociety with them, till his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with them becomes ſin. The ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt muſt prove that every one ſins that keeps in the Communion of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> or elſe he himſelf muſt inevitably lye under the guilt of ſin for ſeparation from it, there being nothing that can juſtifie the with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing from the ſociety of that Church wherein a Chriſtian was baptized but the unlawfulneſs of continuing it.</p>
                  <p>Nor is it any corruptions that are crept in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Church, which ſtill remaines true and and Faithful as to its conſtitution and Eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tials, that will make it a Chriſtians duty to withdraw from it or to gather new Churches in and out of it, though it be upon pretence of purer adminiſtrations. (Which by the way) is all that is pleaded by moſt of our adverſaries againſt us, <hi>viz.</hi> Some defects or Corruptions in the exerciſe and adminiſtration of Church order and diſcipline,) for there is no Church on earth perfectly free from theſe; and as it is proved in theſe enſuing Sermons (eſpecially upon the latter text.) So is it excellently done by the famous Mr. <hi>Norton</hi> in his anſwer to <hi>Apollius</hi> as I find him quoted by Dr. <hi>Edward
<pb facs="tcp:152572:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>Stillingfleet</hi> in his <hi>Irenicum</hi> p. <hi>111.</hi> That it is Lawful for Chriſtians to joyn with Churches ſo defective: and if it be Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to joyn with them it muſt needs be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful to ſeparate from them, for how can the God of Love and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity endure any rents or Schiſmes in the Body of Chriſt? and then, how dare any one for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake the Communion of that Church whereof they are natural and immediate members, if they be not aſſured, that it is either no Church or a falſe one, or that it is unlawful to hold communion with it.</p>
                  <p>This is evidently is the Caſe of our Church in her ſeparation, from the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> the main ground hereof being the ſin of Communicating with that Church in her Idolatry and ſuperſtition, and the impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of Communicating with her, and not partaking in her ſins, the practice of her Idolatry being made a neceſſary condition of her Communion. In this caſe it was evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently a ſin to Communicate with her, ſo that unleſs our Brethen can prove it a like ſin to Communicate with us in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> they can never juſtifie their ſeparation from us meerly for purer Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion.

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:152572:19" rendition="simple:additions"/>whileſt ſome other duties, as great as they, are paſt by and neglected, as if they were no part of Religion: and on the contrary ſome ſins they fear with very very great tenderneſs, when their Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers can ſcarce make their Conſciences take any notice of others, as great and damnable. The Papiſt ſeems ſo ſenſible of the good of unity, and the evil of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions, that he thinks even Tyranny and horrid bloodſhed, and an Uſurpation of an univerſal Monarchy in the Church, to be not onely lawful, but alſo neceſſary for the cure and prevention: in the mean time to make him as ſenſible of the ſinful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of theſe unlawful means, and the neceſſity of a ſerious, ſpiritual righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and Chriſtian love and meekneſs, and forbearance, is a very difficult, almoſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible thing.

                  <p>Thus St. <hi>Paul</hi> wrote with his Brother <hi>Soſthenes</hi> to the Church of God, which was at <hi>Corinth,</hi> nor wrote he ſo to them onely: but
<note n="b" place="margin">verſe 2.</note> 
                     <hi>with</hi> them to <hi>all that in
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:152572:20"/>every place call upon the name of the Lord Jeſus, both theirs and ours:</hi> The words then are ſpoken to us alſo, and all Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers in all places to the Worlds end. Now the Apoſtle intending to condemn many vices in theſe Corinthians, that he might not ſeem to do it out of malice, or ſpleen, or envy, he begins firſt with a true com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of their gifts and vertues, that they were inriched in all knowledg, and in all utterance, that they came behind others in no gift
<note n="c" place="margin">verſe 7.</note>. But alas, as knowledge is apt to puſſe us up, ſo theſe Corinthians began in their pride to divide themſelves from each other: So that
<note n="d" place="margin">verſe 12.</note> one cryed, I am for <hi>Paul,</hi> another I am for <hi>Apollo,</hi> and a third I am for <hi>Cephas;</hi> therefore to make way for a ſharp reproof hereof, the Apoſtle brings in this grave obteſtation in the text. Now, <hi>I beſeech you</hi> (ſaith he) though I might be bold in Chriſt to enjoyn and command, yet for love ſake I rather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you. <hi>I beſeech you, Brethren,</hi> I do it in the bowels and affections of a brother: Nay, and <hi>by the Name of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> that is, by the power and authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Chriſt, and for the honour and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Chriſt. I <hi>Paul</hi> ſo ſpeak as if Chriſt himſelf did ſpeak unto you. (For, alas,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:152572:20"/>how the name of God, and how the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Chriſt is blaſphemed through your diviſions, he that runs may read it) and therefore for his ſake I beſeech you. <hi>By the Name of our Lord,</hi> that is by vertue of that commiſſion and authority, I have received from him, who is our Lord, and if he be our Lord, where is his honour: and in <hi>the Name of our Lord Jeſus,</hi> he, who is your Saviour, and as you hope for Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by him: <hi>Our Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> he that is the anoynted of God, anoynted to be our Prophet, Prieſt and King; every word in the obteſtation hath a ſufficient weight to awaken us to attend it. What even this exhortation, <hi>I beſeech you, Brethren, by</hi> that <hi>Name of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that ye all ſpeak the ſame thing, and that there be no diviſions amongſt you, but that ye per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly be joyned together in the ſame mind, and in the ſame judgement.</hi> It is a ſtrange kind of earneſtneſs, and importunity the Apoſtle uſeth, as elſewhere, ſo here, in this matter. He was deeply ſenſible of the evil of diviſions, how they prejudice Gods truth; for whileſt they that profeſs it, cannot agree in it, the Fool is ready to ſcoff at it, <hi>and to ſay in heart there is no God:</hi> and how they endanger the Church
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:152572:21"/>and weaken it; no engine, that Satan and Anti-chriſt can uſe, more than this, the cutting of it into ſhreds, like the Levites Concubine; the blowing of the Coals of contention in it: yea, how they endanger the Souls of men, by ſeparating them from the Church, and ſo from Chriſt, who is the head thereof. The Apoſtle was deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſenſible of the evil of diviſions, and therefore is ſtrangely, and more than ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily importunate in this Exhortation, uſhering it in with manifold obteſtations. See <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.1, 2, <hi>If there be any conſolation in Chriſt, if any comfort in love, if any fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip of the Spirit, if any compaſſion and mercy, fulfil my joy, that you be like mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, having the ſame love, being of one ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, of one mind.</hi> Epheſ. 4.1, <hi>I the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner of the Lord beſeech you that you walk worthy of that vocation wherewith you are called, with all lowlyneſs and meekneſs, with long-ſuffering, forbearing one another in love, endeavouring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.</hi> Rom. 16.17, 18, <hi>Now I beſeech you, Brethren, mark them that cauſe diviſions among you, and avoid them, for they ſerve not our Lord Jeſus;</hi> But to name no more, this in the Text is full enough, <hi>Now I beſeech you Brethren, by

                  <p>Which words being apparently an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation, muſt be handled in ſuch me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, as beſt ſutes with the nature there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>

                  <p n="1">1.

<pb n="8" facs="tcp:152572:22"/>An univerſal accord amongſt them is to be endeavoured, ſo far as is poſſible in judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, affection and action, this is the ſum and ſubſtance of the Text.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Exhortation is to an unity in judgement; ſo the Apoſtle expreſly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes it, in the latter words, <hi>that ye be perfectly joyned together in the ſame mind, and the ſame judgment.</hi> It is a thing much to be deſired, and by all good means to be endeavoured, that (according to our Churches prayer) God would give to all Nations, Unity, Peace, and Concord, but eſpecially that all, that do profeſs his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Name, may alſo agree in the truth of his holy Word, at leaſt, in the main and moſt ſubſtantial truths thereof, and ſo that they may be perfectly joyned together in the ſame mind, and in the ſame judgement.

                  <p n="1">1. That you all ſubmit to the ſame Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. For there is a neceſſity of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment to prevent confuſion: of one Government both in Church and State to prevent diviſion. Where there is an Anar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy or no Government, confuſion muſt needs follow among the members. As it was in <hi>Iſrael, When there was no King in</hi> Iſrael <hi>every man did that which was right in his own eyes</hi>
                     <note n="l" place="margin">Judg. 17.6</note>: and where there are in one body diverſe Governments, diviſion muſt needs follow among the members, as it was in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> when <hi>Jeroboam</hi> ſet up a faction againſt the Houſe of <hi>David</hi>

                     <note n="n" place="margin">Pro. 28.2.</note>. Indeed we in this Nation need not be told the miſeries of no Government, or of many Governments, or many Governors, our own experience will ſure, for one Age make us dread it, and inexcuſable fools, if we deſire it. We have all the reaſon then in the World to obey the Apoſtles pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:152572:25"/>of ſubmitting to them, that of right are ſet over us: and being ſubject to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Ordinance of Man, for our own as well as for the Lords ſake
<note n="o" place="margin">1 Pet. 2.13</note>. And whoever ſpeaks otherwiſe, inciting men to caſt off this yoke from their necks: they are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſtiled children of <hi>Belial,</hi> their hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh deſign is clean contrary to the Text, to cauſe diviſions and offences amongſt you.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. As it is neceſſary to prevent diviſions that you ſubmit to the ſame Government ſo that you walk by the ſame rule; What is that? It is either Principal or Subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate. Principal, even the Law and the Teſtimony, the ſacred Scriptures: Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate, even according to the Scriptures, the rules, and canons, and Cuſtomes of the Church, without a due reſpect to both theſe rules in their right places, it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible Chriſtians ſhould ſpeak all the ſame things, but there will be diviſions among them. I dare aſſert, and think it not difficult to maintain by the Scriptures, as well as clear reaſon, that there is an obligation upon the members of that Church in which they were born, bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and bred up, to ſubmit unto, and obey the rules, and canons, and cuſtomes
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:152572:25"/>thereof, if they be not able to prove them contrary to the Scriptures, or the clear light of natural reaſon in us, or at leaſt ſuch concluſions as are properly, directly, and evidently deduced from them. There is much in that argument of the Apoſtle to confirm the ſober-minded herein.

O no, if any of its rules or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctions, appears to be contrary to the Word of God, like <hi>Nebuchadnezzar's</hi> to the three Children, to fall down to his I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage; or <hi>Darius</hi> his to <hi>Daniel,</hi> not to pray to any other God; or the High-Prieſts to the Apoſtles, not to ſpeak in the name of Jeſus, then muſt we anſwer with them; <hi>whether must we obey God or man, judge ye.</hi> But then we muſt not deny our obedience to ſuch Church rules and canons, as repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to God's Word upon light ſurmiſes,

<pb n="24" facs="tcp:152572:30"/>endeavouring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace:</hi> For, ſaith he, <hi>there is one Body, one Spirit, one Hope, one Lord, one God, and Father of all.</hi> There is but one God, and great reaſon then we ſhould endeavour unity, and unanimity, and uniformity in the worſhip and ſervice of this one God. Thoſe that have ſeveral Gods, may well have ſeveral ways, and ſeveral forms to worſhip them; as the Marriners in <hi>Jonah</hi> called every one upon his God. When ſeveral Gods are afoot, all Games muſt go forward; but now we all profeſs but one God, unchangeably one, the Maker of Heaven and Earth, the Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and he is always of one mind, he is not for one thing ſometimes, and another thing other times, like a diſtempered Stomack, but God is ſtill of one and the ſame mind; and therefore that which pleaſeth him at one time, the ſame words and things, if they proceed from the ſame heart, muſt needs find the ſame acceptance always.

<note place="margin">See it page 66.</note> whom perhaps ſome will rather hear than us, if we ſhould ſpeak the ſame words. I ſhall
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:152572:35"/>amongſt many particulars urge only four things, with reference to the Church, that ſhews the need you have to ſpeak the ſame things, and that there be no diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons amongſt you.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. This is the only way to forward the work of God for the building up of the Church; which Faction and diviſions on the other hand obſtructeth, ſo as nothing more. You often read in Scripture, of edifying the Body of Chriſt,
<note place="margin">Eph. 4.12. 2 Cor. 12.19.</note> and of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all things to edifilcation. The expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is metaphorical, taken from material buildings, often uſed by the Apoſtle with application to the Church of God, and the ſpiritual building thereof:
<note place="margin">1 Tim. 3.15.</note> for the Church is the Houſe of the Living God; and all Chriſtian-members of this Church are as ſo many ſtones of this building, whereof the houſe is made up: and the bringing in unbelievers into the Church, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting them to the Chriſtian Faith, is as the fetching of more ſtones from the Quarries to be laid in the building. Now the building in it ſelf (and that is edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) is the well and orderly joyning together of Chriſtian men as living ſtones in truth and love, that they ſpeak the ſame things, and that there be no divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:152572:35"/>amongſt them, that they may grow together, as it were, into one entire building, to make up a ſtrong and come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly houſe for the Maſters uſe and honour.
<note n="a" place="margin">1 Pet. 2.9.</note> Indeed there is nothing more condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth hereunto, than Peace, Love, and Concord: Knowledge is very little or nothing but a puff in compariſon of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, in order to Edification:
<note n="b" place="margin">1 Cor. 8.1</note> It may ſwell, and look big, and make a ſhew, but Charity doth the deed:
<note n="c" place="margin">1 Cor. 1.10.</note> It lays the ſtones together, and makes them couch cloſe one to another, and binds them up with Fillings and Cement to make them hold. Hence that wiſe Maſter-builder S. <hi>Paul,</hi> that knew well what belongs to this work, when he ſpeaks of compact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Church into a building, mentions the edifying of it ſelf in love.
<note n="d" place="margin">Eph. 4.16.</note> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed when all the Workmen intend the main buſineſs, each in his place and office performing their appointed task with chearfulneſs and good agreement, then doth the work go on, and the building gets up apace and ſtrongly; but when one man draws one way, and another another way, one will have things done after this faſhion, another after that, one mars what another makes, pulls down what
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:152572:36"/>another ſets up, how is it poſſible while things go thus, that ever the building ſhould be brought to any perfection or handſomneſs? and therefore well doth the Apoſtle joyn theſe two together, <gap reason="foreign">

<note n="f" place="margin">James 3.16.</note> Strife will make ill work, it will build up nothing, unleſs it be <hi>Babels</hi> walls: It is peace and concord that builds up the walls of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> which as it hath its name from peace, ſo hath it alſo its perfection from peace; and then, and not before, ſhall <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> be built, as a City that is at unity in it ſelf;

                  <p n="2">2. As this is the way to build the Church, ſo it is the way to preſerve in both in peace, beauty, and ſafety.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In peace. The concord of Familie
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:152572:36"/>is their peace, ſo is amity and concord in the Church; whereas the diviſions and diſcords of Chriſtians diſturbs their minds, and diſcompoſeth the Church: <hi>Pray for the peace of</hi> Jeruſalem,
<note n="h" place="margin">Pſa. 125.</note> ſaith the Pſalmiſt; but by different forms and ways there is a breach of that peace: ſuch diviſions in the Church are like wars and tumults in the Commonwealth, they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compoſe, and ſet it out of order. It was Sir <hi>Henry Wotton</hi>'s excellent ſaying, <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſputandi pruritus Scabies Eccleſiae:</hi> The Itch of Diſputing doth cauſe the Scab of the Church. Every Sect finds ſome little pleaſure in ſcratching, by zealous wrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings and diſputes for their ſeveral Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, till the blood be ready to follow; and at length it proves the bain of peace, and charity, and love, which is the very life and ſoul of Chriſtian Religion: Now is not this, or ſhould it not be an effectual Motive to this Unity, Unamity, and Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity? How dear ſhould be the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches peace to every member thereof? <hi>Dulce nomen pacis,</hi> the very name of peace ſounds ſweetly to the ear: there is ſuch a mixture of pleaſantneſs and profitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in it, as wrapt the Pſalmiſt into admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, <hi>ut prius miraretur quàm oſtende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret,</hi>

<note n="i" place="margin">Pſa. 133.1.</note> 
                     <hi>Behold how good and pleaſant a thing it is, Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren to dwell together in unity:</hi> ſome things are pleaſing, not good, as Epicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſm and Good-fellowſhip; ſome things good, not pleaſing, as Faſting and Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdom, but this both; for pleaſure, it is like the Oyl poured out on <hi>Aaron</hi>'s Head; for goodneſs, it is like the Dew on <hi>Hermon</hi>'s Hill, which made the Valleys fruitful. So good and pleaſant it is, that nothing can be pleaſant without it: It is the deſire of all hearts, the reſt of all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, the end of all Contentions, <hi>pacem te poſcimus omnes,</hi> nothing more deſira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in Families, in Kingdoms, much more in the Church: And therefore leſt we violate the Churches peace, it concerns us to ſpeak the ſame things, leſt there be no peace but diviſions amongſt us.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is the way to preſerve the Church in beauty and honour; the concord of Chriſtians is their beauty and honour, and their diviſions and diſcord is their defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity and ſhame.

Indeed nothing more tends to the Churches diſhonour, and Chriſts diſhonour, than this: there is no ſuch ſcandal to the Churches Enemies of all ſorts, than this: the common Enemies of the truth of Religion, are chiefly A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſm and Superſtition; and wherefore ſerveth the home-differences of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, eſpecially about indifferent things, about Geſtures, and Veſtures, and other indifferent Rites and Formalities, that for ſuch things as theſe, (things in their own nature indifferent, and never intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be otherwiſe impoſed, than as mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of circumſtances and order) men ſhould deſert their Miniſterial Charges, fly out of the Church as out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> ſtand at open Deſiance againſt lawful Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and ſharpen their tongues and pens with ſo much petulancy and virulen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy as ſome have done; wherefore ſerveth this, but to the diſhonour of Chriſtians

                  <p n="1">1. To the Athieſt: for he, till all men be of one Religion, and agreed in every point thereof too, (which I doubt will never be whilſt the World laſteth) think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it the beſt wiſdom to be of none, nay, makes it his beſt paſtime to jeer at all: The agreement of Chriſtians is an ocular demonſtration to the World, that they have a certainty of the Faith which they profeſs, and that it is of a healing nature, and tendeth to the felicity of the world: ſo that never was Chriſtians obſerved to live in an undivided Unity and unfained love, but the very Infidels and ungodly round about them did reverence both them and their Religion for it; whereas their diſcords and diviſions give occaſion to Atheiſts and Unbelievers to blaſpheme, as if there were no certainty in their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, or as if it were of a vexatious and deſtructive tendency: ſo that never were Chriſtians divided, implacable, and bitter againſt each other, but it made them and their profeſſion a ſcorn to the unbelieving and ungodly World. Their deſpiſing and vilifying one the other, teaches the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to deſpiſe and vilifie them all: as a well
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:152572:38"/>ordered Army, and a City of uniform; and comely building is a pleaſing and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viting ſight to beholders, whereas a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed Rabble and ruinous heap bree is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrence; even ſo the very ſight of the concordant ſociety of Chriſtians, is ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to thoſe without; whereas their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreements and ſeparations makes them odious. Hence the former conduceth much to the converſion and ſalvation of men, and the latter hardens men in wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs, and hinders their coming into the Church, and their obedience to the truth. Who loveth to thruſt himſelf into a fray? and what wiſe men will joyn with drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken men that are fighting in the ſtreets?

For my part I am no Enemy unto men, but only to their Errours: and if I may be believed in this Infidel, yet credulous Age, I have no inward rancour or ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will to a <hi>Presbyterian,</hi> but love the mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and ſober with all my heart, and do conceive him the beſt of Sects, though fouly too blame in laying a Foundation for others that are intolerable to build up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and countenancing them when his

Paſſion ſeldom advantageth Truth; the wrath of man worketh not the righteouſneſs of God.</p>
                  <p>The nature and evil of Schiſm have been by many excellent Authors largely and irrefragably opened and manifeſted; yet may theſe following Sermons, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in this preſent juncture of Publick Affairs, add ſome further light thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, at leaſt by way of Genuine Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence: For if mens Obligation to their own Paſtors, and the ſinfulneſs of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaking the Publick Aſſemblies upon mens modern pretences be once cleared, where the Schiſm is, and at whoſe door it lies, will eaſily appear to any intelligent man. Hence am I apt to think the Truths here delivered (for ſo I really think them) will be diſguſtful to this gain-ſaying and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious Generation: Nor need we think it ſtrange, that men ſhould account us their Enemies for their ſakes (for telling them the truth) Thus do we but ſip of
<pb facs="tcp:152572:72" rendition="simple:additions"/>that Cup our Saviour, and his Prophets, and Apoſtles drunk of; and we are but ſprinkled with that Baptiſm that they were baptized withal.</p>
                  <p>But this we may think ſtrange, that theſe Truths ſhould be ſo unſavoury unto them, in whoſe mouths they were once thought ſound and indiſputable; nay, that thoſe who will not allow any thing, no, not a pin or a nail, the leaſt circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in Divine Worſhip, without an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Scripture for it, and who cannot (I ſuppoſe) contradict the Doctrines here preſſed and proved out of the Scriptures, nay, who themſelves (when time was) did urge them as ſeriouſly and vigorouſly as we now can do, ſhould now, when they are put in mind of them, ſet their brains upon the Rack to invent new Pleas and Apologies (grounds only in their own fancies) to elude them.</p>
                  <p>Let but any ſober forreign Divine, or Divines of the Reformed Churches, that are unintereſted in the Cauſe, conſider well the Conſtitution of our Church, and compare what hath been formerly ſaid by the beſt <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Guides againſt Tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration (as they are well and faithfully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented by Mr. <hi>Aſhdon</hi> in his Treatiſe of
<pb facs="tcp:152572:73" rendition="simple:additions"/>Toleration diſapproved,) and as they are handſomely applied to our preſent caſe in the Book of Toleration not to be abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed:) I ſay, let any impartial Judge com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare theſe with what is ſaid in pretence of Anſwer, and I think he could not but be aſtoniſhed with the evident diſcovery of a love of contradiction in the greateſt Pretenders to Love and Godlineſs the World hath ever had: For what can be more light and frivolous in any rational men, then to think to paſs over ſuch weighty conſiderations (as are in thoſe Books offered) with ſuch ſlight of hand, as only to anſwer, that none can know the Nonconformiſts minds better than them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; that when they inveighed againſt Toleration, they never meant that them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſhould not be tolerated; that now the Kings Indulgence, or permiſſion of their Separate Meetings, frees them from the imputation of Schiſm; that the intru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Miniſters come only as Aſſiſtants to the Pariſh-Miniſter, and ſo offers no vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to the peoples obligation to him: And laſtly, that their Meeting-places are in the nature of Chappels of Eaſe.</p>
                  <p>This ſeems to be as like the Womans looking at her Apron-Strings (as we uſe
<pb facs="tcp:152572:73" rendition="simple:additions"/>to ſay) to find an Excuſe, when put hard to it, as poſſible can be imagined? What will not men do to uphold a Party they have Eſpouſed? Well may they plead for Chriſtian Liberty unweariedly, that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not do, without this Liberty, to ſay and unſay, and ſay what they liſt.</p>
                  <p>Now, as I think, theſe Novel Pleas for Private Affemblies, in oppoſition to Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick meetings, muſt of themſelves ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily fall before the ſound Doctrines delivered in theſe Sermons; ſo do I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them ſo ungrounded in holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and ſo inconſiſtent with ſound Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and the experience of any ordinary Chriſtian, that they deſerve no ſerious Confutation.</p>
                  <p>But yet becauſe Mr <hi>Baxter</hi> (a man to whom for ſome of his Works I bear a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry great reverence) hath (in his Sacrile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Deſertion of the Holy Miniſtry) laid theſe particulars down, as being ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory to himſelf, and offers them to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers for ſatisfaction of their Conſciences, and anſwering our Objections againſt them: I humbly conceive this Reverend Perſon hath herein written not like him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; and as if he had repented of any good he had done, or hoped to do by his

Thus hath he cheriſhed us (of the Church) with one hand, and ſmitten us with the other: Thus hath he acted the part of an unfaithful Phyſitian, who when afraid his Cure ſhould be wrought, too ſoon adminiſters contrary Phyſick.

It is well known, that if his Majeſty ſhould not only Approve, but Command, and that not only by Declaration, but by Act of Parliament, that which is but ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected to be unlawful; nay, perhaps de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared by all parties to be in it ſelf indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent, the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> is not apt to change his judgment, or practiſe for it, but is oftentimes more hardened in his oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereunto, by its being commanded, and how then can a bare permiſſion now ſerve their turns? His Majeſty only per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits and leaves men to the guidance of their own Conſciences what to do, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to forſake the Publick Aſſemblies, and ſet up their ſeparate Meetings or no; ſo that if there be no ſatisfactory ground
<pb facs="tcp:152572:75"/>for a good Conſcience to do it, the ſaid Declaration muſt needs leave them as guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Schiſm from the Church, (though not as rebellious againſt his Majeſties Laws) as before.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Reaſons which the King is pleaſed to acknowledge did prevail with him, are evidently Politick, to tolerate theſe Meetings not for themſelves, but ſome other ends and reaſons of State, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to ſecure his quiet at home, while he is ingaged in Forreign Wars. Now how can this ſatisfie Conſcience of the lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs thereof, or free the Actors from the guilt of ſeparation? Surely no more than thoſe inconveniences and unlawful actions are juſtifiable becauſe <hi>David</hi> winked at them, and ſuffered them go unpuniſhed, when he cryed out the Sons of <hi>Zerviah</hi> are too hard for me.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. By the Declaration, the Argument for Conformity taken from wrath only is removed, only the penalty is taken off, the directive part of the Law, I conceive, is ſtill in force; ſo that if it did at all oblige Conſcience before, Conſcience hath no more liberty now than then, though the body and purſe have.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. That which (in my judgment) leaves
<pb facs="tcp:152572:76" rendition="simple:additions"/>them inexcuſeable is, that his Gracious Majeſty in his ſaid Declaration is pleaſed in terms to acknowledge the Church of <hi>England</hi> is eſtabliſhed by Law, and makes it the ſtanding Rule, and that in oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and contradiction to private Meetings, yea, though they ſhould be allowed of according to the Indulgence. His expreſs meaning and reſolution is declared to be, that the National Church of <hi>England</hi> ſhould be preſerved entire, as the Baſis, Rule, and Standard of Publick Worſhip among us. Now this evidently ſuppoſeth all other (though tolerated) Meetings, beſides Church-Aſſemblies, to be againſt the Rule, and Sects and Schiſmes from the National Church. In this is manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly implyed, that to ſet them up, is to do that which the Ancient Fathers, eſpecially S. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> and our Modern Orthodox Divines, both Epiſcopal and Presbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, have ſo earneſtly declaimed againſt; viz. <hi>Erigere Altare contra Altare;</hi> to ſet up Altar againſt Altar, a Church in a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Church independent from it, yet conſiſting of ſuch as are its Natural Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers; to break this Churches Unity, and to divide the Members thereof, which apparently tends to the deſtruction of the
<pb facs="tcp:152572:76" rendition="simple:additions"/>whole: if the Church of <hi>England</hi> (as it is ſettled by the Act of Uniformity) be eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed as the ſtanding rule for doctrine and worſhip, then is it impoſſible, I think, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend thoſe that renounce Union and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with it and the publick aſſemblies thereof, though under pretence of exerciſing purer adminiſtrations. For ſo Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> ſtates the Caſe, and for this conſult Dr. <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Stiling fleets Irenicum</hi> upon the point, <hi>c.</hi> 6. Sure I am it can neither conſiſt with the Doctrines of the old non-Conformiſts, <hi>Ball, Hilderſham, Dod, Perkins,</hi> nor of the ſobereſt moderne diſſenters. So much for that Plea then from the Kings Indulgence.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Like unto it is the ſecond, that the Preachers in theſe ſeparate Meetings look upon themſelves only as aſſiſtants to the pariſh Miniſter, and ſo would they have us to look upon them. Here is ſheeps clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but I fear a Wolf under it. Is it not od that any that will, ſhall have power thus to obtrude himſelf upon the lawfully ſettled Paſtor, how much ſoever he be unacquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with his perſon, or diſſatisfied with his education or principles, ablities or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation? I do not ſpeak it out of rancor or bitterneſs, but in good ſadneſs I look on it as a ſtrange incroachment upon and enſlav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a Pariſh miniſter who being himſelf
<pb facs="tcp:152572:77"/>bound up to Church rules, and orders both by his own Conſcience and the Kings eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing the Church as the ſtanding rule. And how learned and pious and Grave a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine ſoever he be, yet muſt he have his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple at liberty, to chooſe to themſelves ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Paſtor, perhaps a man in holy orders, perhaps not, and he muſt be accounted his Aſſiſtant though he have none, no not the leſt knowledg of him, except (perhaps) he can call to mind, or his Contemporaries can remember him, that ſuch a one was expell'd the Univerſity as a rake heel, or ſtopt of his Degree as a Dunce, and this Ile aſſure you is the Caſe of not a few in theſe parts, ſeveral ſuch being holders up of ſides and factions amongſt us, intruding themſelves into our charges without our conſent, nay, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly againſt it, and gathering together a pail of our people, together with others out of pariſhes adjacent, to worſhip God at the very time of publike worſhip after their own inventions, and yet thoſe muſt be, our Aſſiſtant (forſooth). I marvel, what Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd or Maſter of a Family would be willing to have an Aſſiſtant thus thruſt himelf upon him whether he will or no, and take part of his flock from under his proper care and inſpection and governance upon pretence
<pb facs="tcp:152572:77"/>of aſſiſting him! juſt Such an aſſiſtant I fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy the Woolf in the Fable to be (and

                  <p n="3">3. A like pretence is that of the place of meeting that they muſt be look'd upon as Chappels of eaſe. Bravely ſaid! they are no oppoſite Schiſmatical meetings I warrant you, but as Chappells of eaſe! a notion, that doubtleſs coſt many a noctur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Lucubration or hot diſpute in a private Conference.

But the miſchief is, we of the Church, though we be branded for it, cannot but declare our diſſatisfaction, as much with this as with the other Inventions, and the reaſon is, our own Experience ſtill teacheth us fooles otherwiſe. For ask our experiences, for whoſe caſe theſe new erected Chappels are like to ſerve, and they will peſently an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
<pb facs="tcp:152572:79"/>not for the Church Miniſters, for ſure. (And while we preach and ſtudy to preach Continually being in labours abundant, why ſhould we be enemies to our own ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary eaſe altogether?)</p>
                  <p>Now theſe do evidently occaſion us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite inſuperable troubles; they divide our peoples into ſides and parties; they ſet our people a cockloft in rebellion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us; they do in a few dayes annul all that we have done in many years, towards the bringing our people into a way of order and obedience; they fill the peoples mouths with inſultations againſt their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors; they ſet them in a poſture of defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance againſt us; they render it moſt diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult for us either to keep an amicable Correſpondence with our people or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure our tithes and juſt maintenance from them; they enſlave us to their humors, for if we diſpleaſe or reprove them in the leaſt, or deny them any Common cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſie, preſently they tell us, they can go to theſe ſeparate meetings and be wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come; and ſo many miſchiefes hereof we daily feel, that I may juſtly Conclude this with that which our Adverſaries hate, even an <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for they certainly Unhinge the Government both of the whole
<pb facs="tcp:152572:80"/>Church and of every particular Pariſh.</p>
                  <p>But perhaps theſe Chappels of eaſe are for the peoples eaſe or profit, if they be, it is juſt as <hi>Jeroboams Dan</hi> and <hi>Bethel</hi> was,

                  <p n="1">1. My duty in reſpect of the Church of God, as a Member, but eſpecially as a Miniſter thereof. As a Member, for it is every Chriſtians duty, to inform himſelf by the beſt meanes he can, how it fareth with the Church of God, but eſpecially
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:152572:82"/>to take notice of, and be affected with the State of that particular Church, whereof he is an immediate member. Men are moſt what too inquiſitive of news, behold this is the news we ſhould inquire after. When Gods people were in battel againſt the Philiſtines, and had the Ark of God with them in the Camp, it is ſaid

So when there came one to <hi>David</hi> out of the Camp of <hi>Iſrael</hi>

Nay <hi>Moſes</hi> being in the height of honour in <hi>Pharoahs</hi> Court did not onely inquire, but went out to his
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:152572:82"/>brethren and looked on their burdens
<note n="d" place="margin">Exodus, 2.11.</note>, All theſe examples teach us that it is our duty, as to inform our ſelves about, ſo to conſider the burdens of Gods Church, and be affected with the miſeries thereof, and every one in our ſeveral places, to have a care of the cauſe of Religion in the world, and eſpecially we ought continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to inportune the Lord in behalf there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and never forget it in our prayers to God.

                  <p n="3">3. The Text ſaith <hi>this was a burden to to Gods people, to have this reproach caſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them,</hi> as it is certainly to every true Proteſtant and godly man, to hear of the ſeparatiſts inſolenttaunts to the congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Church and the miniſters there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Of theſe that were ſo ſorrowful for the ſolemne Aſſemblies, the Lord ſaith to his Church theſe are of thee, they are natural &amp; Kindly children of the true Church, that do ſtand thus affected.</p>

Hence when the foundation of the Temple was laid, under <hi>Zorobabel,</hi> Gods people that had ſeen no better rejoyced in it: but the Prieſts, and <hi>Levites,</hi> and chief of the fathers, who were Ancient men, that had ſeen the firſt houſe, <hi>they wept with a loud voice, while the reſt ſhouted for joy</hi>

O it grieved their hearts, to ſee how far ſhort that houſe, which God was now to have, came ſhort in beauty and glory, of that that God had had before in <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem.</hi> For as much then as it is every ones duty eſpecially the miniſters, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the State of the Churches and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially that of which they are members, and miniſters, to be affected with them, and to pray for them, and by all means to oppoſe the enemies thereof. And there is none of us, but ſtand in great need to be well grounded in theſe points that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late to the Church, leaſt we be ſeduced by the cunning and diligence of ſeducers, that are abroad in the world, and all our comfort will be augmented, if by the light
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:152572:87" rendition="simple:additions"/>of reaſon, and Gods word preached from ſuch Texts (as this I have read) we can prevent the Apoſtacy of any from the Church, and can diſcover the wickedneſs of thoſe that are dayly forſaking the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies thereof. And it cannot but be matter of greateſt grief to the truly godly to ſee the ſolemne Aſſemblies neglected, or unfrequented, or private congregations erected in oppoſition unto them. All theſe particulars ſhew I have great reaſon to make choice of the Text and ſuch like unto it, till I have ſo fully diſcharged my duty and diſcovered the mind of God out of the Scriptures about it, that I may leave the forſaking of our Church aſſemblies in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>excuſable, ſo that they can never plead Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance of their duty and ſin, and that I may ſay <hi>liberavi animammeam,</hi> I have deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered mine own ſoul.

                  <p>

                  </p>
                  <p>For the coherence of the Text, I ſhall wiſh you to look no further back then the 22 <hi>verſe.</hi> For the Apoſtle haveing in the former part of the Chapter ſhewn them, that the Sacrifice of Chriſts body,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:152572:88" rendition="simple:additions"/>which he once offered, hath for ever tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en away ſin. He preſſeth thence a double exhortation. The firſt in 22 veſe <hi>let us draw near to God,</hi> how? even in and through Chriſt, <hi>with a true heart and full aſſurance of faith,</hi> &amp;c. And the Second is in the 23 verſe. <hi>Let us hold faſt the profeſſion of our faith without wavering:</hi> that is, this Doctrine of Chriſt ſacrificed and the merits thereof; The truth we have received from Chriſt, let us avow it, and not in time of tryal upon any condition forſake it. Now this exhortation he ſtrengtheneth, by giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of directions, for furthering their obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience thereunto: the firſt is, Chriſtans mutually ſtirring up, and ſharpening one another amongſt themſelves; that is a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial help to conſtancy in the true Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and a preſervative againſt Apoſtacy, together with a godly ſtriving one with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, who ſhall be firſt in love and well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doing. verſ. 24. <hi>Let us conſider one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to provoke to love and good works.</hi> And,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Another means to this end, is the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenting Chriſtian congregations &amp; aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies. So comes in my Text. <hi>Not forſaking</hi> &amp;c. In the words you have evidently two parts.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. The duty is to keep cloſe to, and not to forſake the Aſſemblies of the Church.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The fault taxed in ſome amongſt them is, that in Schiſm, or pride, or purpoſe of Apoſtacie they withdrew themſelves from theſe Church aſſemblies, and ſo fell back again, or were in the way of falling back, to the open denial of Chriſt: for ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration from the true Church, or the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an ſociety of the faithful therein, is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable ſin, tending to lead men by Schiſm to Apoſtacy, from the profeſſion of the true faith.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. Nature dictates clearly, that ſome time is neceſſary to worſhip God in. For man, being part body, and part ſpirit, is naturally obliged to worſhip God with both external and internal worſhip; to glorifie God both with body and ſpirit, which are his

Thus far time and worſhip ſeemes to fall under one and the ſame command; for as God in creat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the world, did concreate time together with the world: ſo, when God commands any religious worſhip to be performed by men, he withal implicitely commands the neceſſary circumſtance of ſome time, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it may be performed, and it being highly rational, that the diſpoſal of that time ſhould be at the pleaſure of God, whoſe the worſhip is; therefore hath it pleaſed him to ſet a part ſome portion of our time, even a ſeventh part, when he might have required all, indulging us the reſt, even the ſix parts to be imployed according to the neceſſity of our nature. Such is Gods infinite goodneſs

                  <p n="1">1. By Gods manifold precepts, both in the old and new Teſtament, injoyning ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral acts of publique worſhip; ſuch were the commands of circumciſion, and the ſolemne convocation, and ordinance of the Paſſeover, under the Law, their ſeveral feaſts, and their ſacrifices, with the infinite rites appertaining to them, and the ſundry precepts for Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm and the Lords Supper, and publique Prayers, and confeſſions unto God, and col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections for the poor, thoſe ſacrifices well pleaſing unto God under the Goſpel. Theſe and others are outward viſible publique acts of divine worſhip, required by God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. By publique performing of worſhip to God we ſtir up and mutually inflame each others zeal and devotion unto God, and ſo the more publique religious worſhip is, the m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>re acceptable it is unto God, inreſpect of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> in his confeſſion ſaith, <hi>that he was almost raviſhed with the Songs and Prayers of the Church &amp; Congregation,</hi> ſo that the ſpiritual comfort, which he conceived by the ſweet and
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:152572:95"/>heavenly matter, which then the Chriſtians joyntly and orderly made, and in their pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Aſſembles, made him weep for joy. And, Ibelieve, there's ſcarce any Chriſtian, but he hath ſometimes felt his heart moved and affected towards God, in actions of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique worſhip, eſpecially if uniformely and live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly performed, more then at other times.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Publique worſhip is excellent, as publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que; in reſpect of our ſelves, for our joyning in them is a badge of our profeſſion; its a wearing of Gods livery; and confeſſing God before men, it ſhewes to all the world, that we are not aſhamed to profeſs his word and Goſpell, and our beliefe thereof, end o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience thereunto. And on the contrary our forſakeing the publique aſſemblies, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in God is rightly and purely worſhiped, bord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers upon a Apoſtacy, and is the next door to a denying of God, and our profeſſion of Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Chriſtianity.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. It is excellent, as publique, in reſpect of God, for the more publique it is, the more it tends, to the honour and glory of God, being a publique teſtimony and acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our dependence upon, and piety to him before all the world, as with the heart we believe, ſo with the mouth we make publique confeſſion of God unto Salvation:
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:152572:96"/>as we have light of grace within us, ſo here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it ſhineth forth before men, that they may ſee our good works, and glorifie our Father in heaven Chriſt tells us that <hi>a candle is not lighted to be put under a buſhel.

                  <p n="5">5. The acception of publique worſhip with God above private, is <hi>de facto,</hi> notorious by manifeſt reaſon of the thing: particularly it is evident in publique prayer, for if the prayer of one righteous man can avail much, how much more will it when the prayers of many aſcends up to the Lord. This muſt needs offer violence to the Kingdome of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and <hi>the violent ſhall take it by force.</hi> Surely in every congregation there are ſome truly righteous, and their preſence cannot but bring down mercies on thoſe others whoſe prayers for themſelves have no promiſe to be

Thou doeſt not ſo ſoon obtain thy deſire, when thou prayeſt alone, as when in the aſſemblies of the Brethren. for in thoſe Aſſemblies there is ſome thing more then prayers even the concord, and conſent, and joyning in Love and Charity, and the cry of the Prieſt, whoſe office it is, to make inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion for the people, and, being of the ſtronger ſize, to carry a long with them the weak prayers of the people, and carry then unto heaven, <hi>Quod quis apud ſeipſum precatus acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pere non poterit hoc cum multitudine precatus accipit. Quare? quia ſi non propria virtus ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men concordia multum poteſt.</hi> The thing that a man cannot obtain by himſelf alone, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing together with the multitude he ſhall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, why? becauſe when his own worth can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, yet the concord and union of the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly may avail much. It is no reproach to call the Churches Liturgy Common prayer, the more common it is the better it is, and the more effectual; when, not onely two or three but a whole Congregation are joyned, nay, all the Congregations of a whole nation do in the ſame words put their Common petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and ſupplications, O what a ſhrill noiſe muſt this needs make in the ears of God. St. <hi>Jerom</hi> likened it to a thunder clap. St. <hi>Eaſti</hi>
                     <pb n="130" facs="tcp:152572:97"/>to the roaring of the Sea, it is like the ſeveral ſtrings of a Well tuned inſtrument that makes a raviſhing harmony, as the flame of one ſtick is nothing to that of a bundle on fire together, ſuch is the devotion of one man to that of a whole Aſſembly, <hi>vis unita fortior,</hi> force vnited is ſomuch the ſtronger, a three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold cable is hardly broken. So do the joynt prayers of Gods people united, and publique<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly put up unto God, move him as it were omnipotently and irreſiſtably, they mount up to heaven, they rap at the gates and cannot eaſily be denyed entrance, like as the petition of a whole Corporation is more avaliable to a King then the ſingle petition of any particular perſon ſuch is the power and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of publique worſhip and devotion. And that by the way is a forceable argument to diſſwade the truely Religious from forſaking the aſſemblies, thats the fifth Propoſition, the more publique religious worſhip is, the better it is.</p>

But what Shall we now think of the time of the Goſpel? Indeed our Saviour Chriſt hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved all diſtinction of places through le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal holineſs, yet hath he ſtill made ample pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion for the authority of places for ſolemn aſſemblies for publique worſhip.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The diſtinction of place through legal holineſs is removed by Chriſt. The Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle and Temple had a legal holineſs and ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonial Sanctity put upon them, becauſe of the Arkes being there
<note n="k" place="margin">2 Chro. 8.11. Exod. 29.43.</note>. There and only there they was to Sacrifice, without an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary warrant to the contrary. As the Hebrews ſay a private Alter was not lawful to be erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:152572:101"/>but by a Prophet; and when ever they prayed they was either to pray in the Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle or Temple

It is in and through his. Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation onely that we call upon God. Therefore he the ſubſtance being come, the ſhadowes are vaniſhed. There is now no legal or ceremonial kind of holineſs in any place however conſecrated, to render any duties there performed more acceptable un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God then if performed by the ſame per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in like manner in any other places. Divine worſhip under the Goſpel is not now tyed to any one place more than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for any typical holineſs in them.

Since all ſuch difference of place is aboliſhed by Chriſt, So that whereſoever we be with <hi>Jeremiah</hi> in the Pit, or <hi>Daniel</hi> in the Lions denn, <hi>Job</hi> on the dung-hil, <hi>Heze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah</hi> in his bed, the three Children in the

So that Chriſtians may lawfully and acceptably worſhip God when and where their covenants direct them, Yet on the other hand be not deceived, as if there was no authority or excellency of ſome places for ſolemn Aſſemblies, for pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique worſhip, ſtill under the Goſpel above others.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Though the ceremonial holineſs, be extinct, yet are there ſome places holy, as ſeparate, and dedicate from a common to holy uſes, though our Temples be not, as the Temple of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was, parts of our worſhip of God, nor tipes of Chriſt body, nor are we bound to ſet our faces towards them when we pray, yet is it written

And although in caſe of Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Religion the meaneſt place is acceptable; yet when God is pleaſed to give his Church Kings to be nurſing fathers, to allow publique places conſecrated for pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique worſhip, with what thankfulneſs then ſhould we repair to them, which many of our Chriſtian Brethren in the world would purchaſe with their whole eſtates and deareſt blood. When God give reſt and quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to his Church from the ten famous Perſecutions, wherein they were glad to Aſſemble not in the fitteſt but ſafeſt places, perhaps in Dens and Caves of the earth, I ſay, when God gave her reſt from them, then did they immediately erect Oratories for publique prayers, not ſumptuous and ſtately, which could not then be poſſible by reaſon of the Churches poverty, nor plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible in reſpect to the worlds envie: but after when God was pleaſed to convert Kings to the Faith then was Temples and Churches preſently built? and in building them no coſt was ſpared, and nothing counted to dear
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:152572:103"/>that was ſpent about them, Sacrilegious wretches are not in theſe times more deſir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to pull down, than thoſe devout pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors of Chriſtianity was to ſet up Churches.

How much better did the poor Heathens improve their natural dictates, than theſe pretenders to the light within, who from the ſight of the neceſſity of ſome convenient place for publique worſhip in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented their Groves, and Oratories, and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples for the ſervice of their Idol Gods, ſo then from all theſe conſiderations. Gods own ſetting a part places for publique Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, under the law, and before it his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving thoſe that his people did ſet a part, the authority that ſuch places have by the

I conclude that Divine worſhip may be truly Publique which as publique is ſo acceptable unto God, there is requiſite as publique perſons Miniſters and People to Aſſemble in it, ſo al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo a publique place conſecrated for the ſame, from which excellent conſideration aſcend we to an higher, which is in the very Text.</p>

The Churches prayers and ſo of that bleſſing which our joynt prayers might bring down with a full meaſure upon us. Of the praiſes thereof, and ſo that chearfulneſs and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viving of ſpirit which we might enjoy, by having fellowſhip in thoſe ſpiritual ſongs where Gods people do ſing of his righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of all theſe benefits men wilfully deprive themſelves, that forſake the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling together in Gods houſe.

It is undoubted that when a pious Chriſtian conſiders theſe things he ought to be deeply affected with them, and neither communicate with a whole Church in any corruptions, that are evident cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions in it, nor yet pertake in the ſins of any the particular members thereof: but obſerving his brothers prophanneſs, his duty is to admoniſh him, and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wail his ſin, and do what lies in him to bring him to a reformation thereof. This is the right courſe, but</p>

                  <p n="1">1. There was never Church on earth free from corruptions, either in the whole or in its perticular aſſemblies, and yet never did the Saints of God forſake them, upon that account. Never was there Church from the beginning of the world, to this day, from one ſide of the Earth to another, pure in all her members. <hi>Adams</hi> houſe that as the firſt Church on earth, yet did it contain <hi>Cain</hi> a bloody murder, as well as <hi>Abel</hi> a devout worſhiper in it. Preſently after did God raiſe up <hi>Seth</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of <hi>Abel,</hi> to be a holy ſeed unto him, and even then did not the Church continue long free from prophane mixtures, but the ſons of God became enamoured with the beatuy, and matched with the daughters of men. And ſo the deluge came upon them. Now from the deluge God preſerved <hi>Noah</hi> in the Ark; there was the Church again,
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:152572:112"/>and behold, in that ark there was accurſed <hi>Cham</hi> as well as a bleſſed <hi>Shem.</hi> As alſo in <hi>Abrahams</hi> family, a ſcoffing <hi>Iſmael</hi> as well as a devout <hi>Iſaac.</hi> And in <hi>Iſaacs</hi> a prophane <hi>Eſau</hi> as well as an holy <hi>Jacob;</hi> And O what Scandals brook out among the Patriarchs! <hi>Ruben</hi> became inceſtuous. <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meon</hi> and <hi>Levi</hi> brethren in evil. After this, when the Church was inlarged into great congregations, and aſſemblies, O what im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient murmuring do we read of among the children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> what foul Idolatries committed in the Wilderneſs, what ſerve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Baalim</hi> time after time in the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> what horrible and ſcandalous ſins were committed amongſt them under the Judges? how was polygamy and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable devorces, and ſetting up high places in the daies of the beſt Kings? and what a deludge of prophaneneſs and Idol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry muſt you needs think there brake out in the worſt, when men did not onely ſin ſecretly but openly? they ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their ſin as <hi>Sodom;</hi> when the Prieſts that ſhould have reſtrained them, led them on by evil examples; when the more holy were as ſignes and proverbs of reproach, and yet in all theſe ſucceſſive generations, we do not read of any ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:152572:113"/>from, or forſaking the Church aſſemblies, as the manner of ſome now is. Its true in Idolatrous times the Saints did refuſe to joyne with the ungodly in Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous worſhip.

Nay, on the contrary we ſhall find that when our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour was born, then was the Church ſo corrupted that the Temple was become a den of thieves, and yet then <hi>Joſeph</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> the parents of Chriſt did joyn themſelves to the congregation in Gods publick worſhip? Nay they went a long Journey with their child Jeſus to ſatisfie the law to offer their turtle Doves and a pair of young Pigeons, and to take part with the Prieſts and Gods people in that which was good and for the reſt they med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled no further then their places required, an Example Saith <hi>Calvin</hi> and <hi>Marlorat</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs againſt our Browniſts, and all our Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratiſts, and Recuſants, and that which may juſtly and finally ſtop their mouths

Gold and Silver is not of more value, out of an imbroydered cup then a leathern purſe, meat is as pleaſing to the palate, as wholſome to the body, out of a clean earthen veſſel, as out of a ſilver Platter, as a candle ſhines as bright in a wooden, as in a Golden candleſtick: why ſhould Gods word then, better worth than thouſands of Gold and ſilver, be leſs valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or the heavenly Manna be diſreliſhed, or the light of our paths be obſcured, by the meanneſs of the miniſters that brings it?

<note n="z" place="margin">Rom. 1.12.</note>. And I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded there is never a Miniſter that is of the moſt excellent gifts (if he have a godly heart) but he can truly ſay that he never heard any faithful Miniſter in all his life, even the meaneſt, but he could deſcern ſome gifts in him, wanting in himſelf, and received ſome profit by him, ſaith Mr. <hi>Hilderſham.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. The fruit and profit, that is to be received by the miniſtry, depends not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly or chiefly on the gifts of the Preacher
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:152572:132"/>but on the bleſſing of God upon his own ordinance; for Miniſters are but Miniſters by whom we believe, and God for his own Glory may give that bleſſing to the more unworthyeſt, he denies to the moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, that the glory may be intirely his own, and that his ſtrength may the more ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in the Miniſters weakneſs.

I may allude to that

<pb n="225" facs="tcp:152572:132"/>which God will be pleaſed to work upon thy heart. Indeed on the other hand it is not poſſible thou ſhouldſt profit by thy Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors miniſtration, if thou attend not, or at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend with prejudice, or without reverence unto, or delight in it, not acknowledging Gods ordinance in it, or nor ſeeking Gods bleſſing upon it. If then there may be a great difference in Miniſters gifts without inequality, if he whom thou thinkeſt meaneſt may excel in his kind, if the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence be from the Lord, and that in order to his own glory, and the Churches beauty and benefit, and the meaneſt be Gods ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance as well as the beſt, and the word be to be eſteemed for it own worth, and his ſake whoſe it is, who ever be the miniſter publiſhing it. If thou may profit by the meaneſt, if the fault be not thy own, and the profit depends not on his gifts, but Gods bleſſing. Then though thou may rightly covet the beſt gifts, and bleſs God for them when thou injoyeſt them, yet mayeſt thou not deſpiſe the meaneſt of Gods Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters nor deſpair of profit by him. Nor is this then a ſufficient plea for forſaking the publick aſſemblies, the Paſtors defects in gifts.</p>

<pb n="226" facs="tcp:152572:133"/>ſuppoſed to be indiſcreet perhaps intollerable. Its true will ſome ſay our Miniſters life is good, his opinions Orthodox, and his gifts excellent, but he behaves himſelf ſtrangely in his place. Either he is alwayes chiding, and reprov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us, A meer <hi>Boanerges,</hi> a ſon of thunder, telling us oft of Hell and Damnation, as <hi>Ahab</hi> ſaid of <hi>Micaiah,</hi> prophecying concerning him ever evil, no good. This made <hi>Faelix</hi> diſtaſte St. <hi>Paul,</hi> when he preached of temperance before him and <hi>Druſilla,</hi> who was moſt unchaſt, and of judgment before him an unjuſt judge; or perhaps he is ridged in keeping us to Church orders: he will not bear with us in what he diſlikes though it were his prudence to paſs by. To this Ioppoſe ſeveral conſiderations. I confeſs there may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcretion in the beſt Paſtors. Its a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult thing both to pleaſe men in wiſdome, and yet to ſave, and not betray their ſoules in faithfulneſs. Yet on the other hand it is ordinary for people to blame them that are faithful, for their faithfulneſs, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the notion of indiſcretion. Remember Gods ſtrict injunction to thoſe watch men of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> to cry aloud and not to ſpare, to warn men from the Lord in every e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:152572:133"/>courſe, and that under pain of being guilty of the blood of their ſouls, that miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carry by their negligence. And if you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider this, how can you wonder if they be very tender of ſuffering any ſin to lie upon you they obſerve unreproved, unreformed, if they fear Gods diſpleaſure more then mans, and take heed leaſt that you call diſcretion be not nicknamed ſo, being in truth Laodicean Lukewarmneſs or want of Zeal. Do but in the next place ſurvey the generality of people in theſe dayes, how dull of hearing are ſome, how fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and untoward others, how nicely Hipocritical and tickle others, and how ſecure others, and it will ſeem almoſt impoſſible for a faithful Paſtor to work on you to reformation, unleſs they ſpeak more then diſcretion and modeſty would almoſt permit.</p>
                  <p>Conſider alſo if it be not better, the people be not reproved and kept awake, and at laſt ſaved through the Paſtors reproofs and corrections, however deemed indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet, then muzzled in their ſins. Is it not better a wholſome though ſmarting plaiſter be laid on, where need is, than that corruption ſhould feſter? doth not more ſouls periſh by the Miniſters luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warme
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:152572:134"/>coldneſs then indiſcretion? bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter are the faithful words of a friend, than the deceitful kiſſes of an enemy. It is bleſſed thunder if it do but awake men out of their ſins, you are much more behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to your Paſtor for his plain dealing, and honeſt hearted reproofs, in faithfulneſs to God, and your ſouls, than if he ſhould flatter you in your ſins with <hi>placentia</hi> ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing pleaſant things. All which particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers duely conſidered, do ſhew how ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs mens forſakeing the aſſemblies is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, becauſe of the prejudice they too often cheriſh againſt his carriages and indiſcretion. Truth is, what ever men pretend, the root of all is ſecret malice againſt the Church miniſtry, bread and nouriſhed in their hearts, or at leaſt want of love, malice can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not judge well of any thing, that comes from him a man loves not, perverts his meaning, conſtrues wrong all his words and actions, ſuckes poyſon from that from which a diligent Bee would draw the ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt honey; in theſe dayes malice between Paſtors and People flames out hot, or at leaſt love is cold, and we know Chriſt bad his Apoſtles look for this entertainment in the world: and ſo we need not think it ſtrange, concerning this fiery tryal. He
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:152572:134"/>bad them expect to be reviled and perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted, and have all manner of evil ſpoken of them, telling them the Prophets of old had been ſo uſed before them

They raiſe diſputes about a pin, or a nail of the Temple, that even endangers the whole fabrick, they ſet the ſame value up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the leaves and bark of the tree, as upon the fruit it ſelf, they make ado a bout a nail, or tile of the houſe, as if it were of the ſame concernment with a pillar or a beam, they look upon that as ſimply evil, which is onely ſo in ſome reſpects, as it is wrong circumſtantiated, or which is onely not perfect in all degrees, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as did but men deliberately prize that which they oppoſe, and proportion their diſpleaſure to the juſt weight thereof,
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:152572:137"/>their contentions would ſoon be calmed, and never become quarrells with the Church of God. Nay indeed in many it is meer ſottiſh Ignorance, that is the cauſe of their forſakeing the aſſemblies of the Church of God, they was never ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the firſt principles of the Oracles of God, and eſpecially they would never learn their obligation to the Church they was baptized in, to hold communion with it. Perhaps theſe men will ſay they would fain do right and go the right way but they would never hearken to their right guides, but gave their ears firſt to ſedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, being a little too much affected with that ſhew of piety they ſaw in them, they put themſelves wholy upon their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections and examples, and ſo are carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed hoodwinckt or blindfold into Schiſms and damnable errors.

To be called of men <hi>Rabbi Rabbi,</hi> is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaunting muſick to any Phariſee and the very eſſence and conſtitutive parts of a Schiſmatick is the eſteem of himſelf and the contempt of others.

                  <p n="3">3. It is the manner of ſome alſo to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake them out of curioſity, this is that baneful weed, which the divel made ſhift to ſteal even into Paradiſe, which hath ever ſince affected the richeſt ſoils, the moſt pregnant underſtandings. <hi>I</hi> do not altogether mean that ſpeculative curioſity about the myſterious parts of our religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, though that be a notorious mean alſo to propagate Hereſies, when men will not be ſoberly wiſe, but will attempt to find out the depths of thoſe myſteries which God hath thought fit to make ſecret; prying into the Ark of the ſecret coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſells of God. But that curioſity of men which is uſually about thoſe little tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling notions, and thin aerial ſpeculati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which do not at all tend to make men wiſer to ſalvation. Men are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to know thoſe divine truths which
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:152572:139"/>tend to Godly practice, therefore they think ſuch preachers as inſiſt of them, dry and inſipid, and forſake them to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low thoſe, who will offer them nicer ſpeculations, be they never ſo unprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the great end of Salvation
<note n="s" place="margin">vide <hi>The Decayes of Chriſtianity in the cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes.</hi>
                     </note>. Beſides there is another curioſity that is deep in the guilt of drawing men from the Aſſemblies, to which they belong. A curioſity to hear ſtrange preachers, they have itching ears: their ordinary food do not pleaſe them, a new beſome ſweeps clean, an uncouth bit is for their palates, a Miniſter of the beſt gifts cannot pleaſe them long, as the Athenians were all for enquirng of news, ſo are theſe men all for novelties. In a ſhort time, they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſte the miniſtry of their ordinary Paſtors and ſo to pleaſe the diſtempered palates of their fickle ſouls, they muſt needs be gadding abroad, to hear every upſtart Mountebank that is near them, and ſo this is one great reaſon of their forſake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their ordinary aſſemblies, as the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of many is.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Another reaſon hereof is covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and intereſt, the great Idol to which the world bowes, as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>they that will be rich fall into divers temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations;</hi>
                     <pb n="240" facs="tcp:152572:140"/>ſo do they fall into this ſin among the reſt.

                     <hi>That ſaid it is in vain to ſerve the Lord,</hi> and what profit is it that we have kept his ordinances? And others there be in the world, that make a ſhow of religion and piety: that have no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther end in their broaching and maintaining Schiſms and ſeparations from the aſſemblies of the Church, then their proper advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages. They make divinity an handmaid, religion a ſtalking horſe to a policy. <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roboam</hi> made the Golden Calves become more venerable Deities, when he found them ſit to ſerve his jealouſies, and <hi>Matchia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels</hi> policy, that ſtates and perſons ſhould ſecure themſelves of religion was a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon practice, long before it was a
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:152572:140"/>rule. In the Old Teſtament we read of mercenary Prophets that turned the office into a trade, that divined for money, and even for handfuls of Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, and pieces of Bread. And in the New St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of deceivers <hi>that ſpeak things they ought not for filthy</hi> Lucres <hi>ſake</hi>
                     <note n="u" place="margin">Titus. 1.11.</note>. And the ſame Apoſtle declaiming againſt the love of money as the root of all evil, he reproves it from its having made men erre from the faith

<note n="y" place="margin">2 Pet. 2.3.</note>. And is it not plain how mens itching ears in this Age, do invite many Mounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banks in Religion, to try experiments up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, when men Nauſeats Old truths, and Old teachers becauſe they are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with them, and embrace Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines and broachers of them becauſe they are new, when men love ſuch teachers and are bountiful to none but ſuch as they love, how can it be doubted but ſome will ſuit themſelves to their diſciples hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours to gain money to themſelves, when by ſowing tares, they can immediately,

And doubtleſs as there be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny leaders, ſo are there many Diſciples in the ſeparation, in whom covetouſneſs, and ſelf intereſt reigns exceedingly, and by it they are animated in their obſtinate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance in their erronious waies, ſo as to ſtop their ears to the charmes of ſound doctrines, charme they never ſo wiſely. Now O that ſuch would conſider, what the character of infamy is, that remaines yet upon <hi>Achan,</hi> that he troubled <hi>Iſrael</hi> to inrich himſelfe. And on <hi>Balaam,</hi> that he not only loved the wayes of cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs, but enſnared the people in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſſes, and upon thoſe in the Goſpel, that made Gods houſe a houſe of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize, and ſo a den of thieves. So that another ground and reaſon of mens forſaking, and propagating ſeparations from our publick aſſemblies. Covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſelfe intereſt. I'le name a</p>

A laſs our good works in this age fall ſhort of the firſt Chriſtians, and then no wonder that our controverſies exceeds theirs; becauſe we ſpend not our time in the one, which is irkſome to fleſh and blood, and therefore we imploy it in hammering and forging the other. <hi>Pharaoh</hi> underſtood this well, though he applyed it ill, when he thought the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals of travelling into the wilderneſs to their divotions, was the effect of their idleneſs, and ſo increaſt their taskes as the propereſt way to divert their deſign; and as ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Idleneſs, ſo alſo natural, is often the cauſe of diviſion. For as experience ſheweth ſuch men as deſert or neglect their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular callings, are moſt apt to run after new teachers; and with the widowes that neglected their office of Miniſtration, to be buſibodies and in many families the
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:152572:142"/>ſhe-zealots, neglecting their proper buſineſs, the guiding of the houſe, have therefore run into conventicles, and upon them have ſeducers acted their deſigns moſt, leading captive ſilly women to become duck coyes to whole families, beſides theſe there are another ſort of Idle perſons to, that can ſit at home, lurke by their fire ſides when they ſhould be in Gods houſe: and though they have little or nothing to hinder them, from attending his ordinance, yet any pretence, a ſhowr of rain, a ſore finger, an Aking head, a thin blaſt of weather will ſerve the turn to divert them.

                  <p n="1">1. I beſeech you Beloved in the Lord, to learn to lay to heart your obligation to attend upon Church Aſſemblies: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of thoſe that endeavour the diviſions of the Church, or to divide and ſeparate you from it. It's the Apoſtles own earneſt
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:152572:143"/>exhortation,
<note n="g" place="margin">Rom. 16 17.</note> 
                     <hi>now I beſeech you brethren mark them which cauſe diviſions and offences, contrary to the Doctrine which you have learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and avoid them.</hi> They are no lovers of your ſouls as they pretend, they are no ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of God for your good, they are no fit guides for ſalvation, that for things meerly external, adiaphorous, &amp; indifferent, matters of meer order or decency, ſeparate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from the ſociety of a true Church, and would have you ſo to do. As if a furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous brainſick ſailor ſhould upon every occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of anger or diſcontent, caſt himſelf o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verboard, preſuming to be ſafe enough out of the ſhip; the ordinary road way of Gods ſaving any ſoul is in the unity of the Church. And that is in a conjunction of them to ſome viſible ordinary congregation according to that,
<note n="h" place="margin">Act. 2.47.</note> 
                     <hi>the Lord added to the Church ſuch as ſhould be ſaved,</hi> but <hi>exceruntè nobis,</hi> they who go out from amongſt us, becauſe they was never of us, as to their hearts, I will not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to judge them as to their final ſtate, yet this I'le ſay, that the Church being the Spouſe of Chriſt, and Schiſm and Hereſie being a work of the Fleſh, an effect of ſo bad cauſes as I have ſhown you fully, ranked by the Apoſtle with fornication, and drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and adultery, and the like. I would
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:152572:144"/>not dye in their ſtate for all the world; take heed hereof then I beſeech you.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But for Church Aſſemblies, I beſeech you labour to love them and delight in them and be more thankful to God, for the liberty you have to frequent and enjoy them, than hitherto you have been. Conſider the cloud of witneſſes that is gone before you.
<note n="i" place="margin">Prov. 2.20.</note> Walk in the way of good men and keep the way of the righteous. They have ever highly eſteemed and diligently frequented the Aſſemblies of the Church. Chriſts Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents being poor dwelt far off <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> yet did they go up every year to the paſſeover, which was the moſt ſolemn Church Aſſemb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that Gods people in thoſe dayes had. Behold a witneſs againſt them that pretend poverty for their excuſe. The Apoſtles af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Chriſts aſcention were continually in the the Temple
<note n="k" place="margin">Luke 24.53.</note>. And <hi>Anna</hi> the Propheteſt, departed not from the Temple but ſerved God, with prayers and faſting night and day
<note n="l" place="margin">Luk. 2 37.</note>. And the Primitive Chriſtians con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued dayly with one accord in Temple
<note n="m" place="margin">Acts 2.46.</note>. Yea, our bleſſed Saviours cuſtome was to the Synagogue every Sabbath day
<note n="n" place="margin">Luke 4.16</note>. And did conſtantly go to every paſſeover at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>
                     <note n="o" place="margin">Joh. 2.1 3.</note>. behold what witneſſes you have againſt thoſe that pretend they have
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:152572:144"/>knowledge and grace enough, they have no need to go to Church, they canno profit by it, but can as well ſerve God at home. <hi>Hezekiah</hi> the King you ſee reſolved ſo ſoon as ever he recovered to go up to the Houſe of God
<note n="p" place="margin">Eſai. 38.32.</note>. <hi>David</hi> loved <hi>the habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Gods houſe, and the place were his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour dwelt</hi>
                     <note n="q" place="margin">Pſal. 26.8.</note>. He counted Gods Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles amiable, his ſoul longed, nay fainted for them
<note n="r" place="margin">Pſal. 84.12.</note>. He made it his choice to be a conſtant companion of them that feared God
<note n="ſ" place="margin">Pſal. 19.63.</note>. He was glad when they ſaid unto him let us go up to the Houſe of God. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold what witneſſes you have alſo againſt thoſe, that being great and rich, take ſtate upon them, and think it a kind of debaſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be conſtant in attending Gods houſe and ſervice. Let us in the fear of God fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low theſe excellent examples, and of what ever degree we be, poor or rich, wiſe or learned, let us never forſake the Aſſembles, or neglect them. If we do, we may eaſily provoke God to gives up to our own hearts luſts, or to hardneſs of Heart in ſin, or to the deluſion of Satan to believe his lies. And therefore let us prize the having opper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities of attending Gods houſe. Let us count it one of the greateſt bleſſings that our candleſtick is not removed, nor
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:152572:145"/>is there a famine of the word in our daies, not is it perſecuted, but that we may ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curely and openly worſhip God in our Churches, and Temples, and not, as our miſerable fore fathers, be glad to do it in hills and holes, in Dens and Caves of the earth. Let us labour to walke wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of this bleſſing while we enjoy it; and to benefit by it, leſt we provoke God continually till he be weary of long ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: and ſo he at length deſtroy his Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle, as a garden, and lay waſt our congregations
<note n="t" place="margin">Lam. 2.6.</note> Let it be our daily prayer for the continuance of our ſolemn aſſemblies, both here and in all places of our divided land
<note n="u" place="margin">Pſal. 122.6.</note>. pray for the peace of <hi>Jeruſalem, They ſhall proſper that love thee.</hi> Thus let us do, every one, our ſelves.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Nay, let us, according to the latter part of the verſe, wherein our text is. Let us exhort one another hereunto; let every one call upon his neighbors, and friends, and draw them to frequent the Church aſſemblies when the Lord had prophecied,
<note n="x" place="margin">Eſa. 2.2.</note> 
                     <hi>That in the dayes of the Goſpel, all nations ſhould flow unto the houſe of the Lord,</hi> he addeth
<note n="y" place="margin">ver. 3.</note> that by this means it ſhould be done. <hi>Many people
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:152572:145"/>ſhall go and ſay: come let us go up to the houſe of God.</hi> Eſpecially let Maſters of Families, and Parents be exhorted, not to think it ſufficient to come to Gods houſe themſelves, but ſee that their Children and ſervants come alſo. A Godly Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian cannot be content, that they ſhould attend him in his houſe, that will not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend and go with him to Gods houſe
<note n="z" place="margin">Exod. 20.10.</note>. you ſee the commandement runs that we do not onely keep the Sabbath our ſelves but muſt look that our Sons, and our Daughters, our men ſervants, and our maidſervants, and ſtrangers do the ſame. And <hi>Joſhuahs</hi> piety runs thus.
<note n="a" place="margin">Joſ. 24.15.</note> 
                     <hi>I and my houſe will ſerve the Lord.</hi> And <hi>David</hi> ſaith expreſly
<note n="b" place="margin">Pſal. 101.7.</note>, <hi>there ſhall no deceitful per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon dwell in my houſe,</hi> no prophane contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of religion. And
<note n="c" place="margin">Pſal. 42.4.</note> he ſpeakes of this as one of the greateſt comforts he had on earth, <hi>that he went with a multitude of them that kept holy day, and led them into the houſe of the Lord,</hi> This if we do not, if we walke not after theſe excellent patterns and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples, if we do not with chearfulneſs go into the Lords Courts, and ſerve the Lord with gladneſs, and come before him with joyfulneſs; if we do not account our dayes and hours pretious that are ſo
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:152572:146"/>beſtowed, if we be not forward to take all holy opertunities, redeeming our time from the world, that we may ſpend them in theſe aſſemblies of Gods people, if we have neither delight nor appetite to the words and Sacraments, or the duties of praiſe and invocation, if we be dull or lumpiſh, heavy and ſpiritleſs in them, if we be not much agrieved to ſee or hear of the congregations being unfrequented or neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected; and glad to ſee, and quick to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the frequency and fulneſs thereof. It is becauſe we do not underſtand our own happineſs in enjoying the benefit of them. As Chriſt ſaid to the woman of <hi>Samaria,</hi> we do not know the gift of God
<note n="d" place="margin">Joh. 4.10.</note>. We are ſottiſh and inſenſible of the greatneſs of that priviledge we may have in waiting upon the aſſemblies. And therefore we are ſo prone to forſake the aſſembling of our ſelves together, as the manner of many is. From which grievous ſin. God of his infinite mercy preſerve us, making us evermore to delight in his houſe and preſence. For Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt his ſake to whom with the father, and the Holy Ghoſt be aſcribed all honour and glory, might, majeſty, and dominion, now, and for ever more. <hi>Amen.</hi>
